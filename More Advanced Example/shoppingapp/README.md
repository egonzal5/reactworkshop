### Notes from Elias!
If you are having trouble running this project (npm start does not work), cd into this folder, then run npm install, then run npm start

If you are looking for some guidance on how this project works, here are some necessary topics to look up:
- React Props (Passing data from one component to another)
- Modifying the state of a component using setState (ensures the DOM is being kept up to date)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
